Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling systems to learn patterns from data rather than relying solely on explicit programming. At its core, a machine learning model is exposed to examples, identifies relationships within them, and then uses those relationships to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

A typical machine learning workflow begins with data collection and preprocessing. Raw data often contains noise, missing values, or inconsistencies, so cleaning and transforming it is a critical step. Once prepared, the data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate how well a model generalizes beyond the data it has already seen.

There are several major categories of machine learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data and is commonly applied to tasks such as image classification, spam detection, and price prediction. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, works with unlabeled data to discover hidden structures, such as customer segments or topic clusters. Reinforcement learning focuses on learning through interaction, where an agent improves its behavior by receiving rewards or penalties from an environment.

Model selection and evaluation are also essential components. Algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks each have strengths and weaknesses depending on the problem and data size. Performance is often measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on whether the task is classification or regression.

As machine learning continues to evolve, it is increasingly integrated into everyday applications, from recommendation systems and virtual assistants to medical diagnosis and autonomous vehicles. While powerful, these systems also raise important questions about fairness, interpretability, and ethical use, making responsible development just as important as technical innovation.
